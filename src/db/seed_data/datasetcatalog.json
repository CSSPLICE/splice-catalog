However, less attention has been paid to the actual code that students produce. In this paper, we investigate programming data by using learning curve analysis to determine which programming elements students struggle with the most when learning in Python. Our analysis extends the traditional use of learning curve analysis to include less structured data, and also reveals new possibilities for when to teach students new programming concepts. One particular discovery is that while we find evidence of student learning in some cases (for example, in function definitions and comparisons), there are other programming elements which do not demonstrate typical learning. In those cases, we discuss how further changes to the model could affect both demonstrated learning and our understanding of the different concepts that students learn.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research},\npages = {143–151},\nnumpages = {9},\nkeywords = {educational data mining, knowledge components, learning curve analysis, programming syntax},\nlocation = {Melbourne, VIC, Australia},\nseries = {ICER '16}\n}"

Many instructors use drill-and-practice strategies to help students develop basic programming techniques and improve their confidence.

However, the relationship between practicing with short programming exercises and performance on larger programming assignments or exams is unclear. This paper describes CodeWorkout, an open-source drill-and-practice system that supports short programming exercises and multiple choice questions. CodeWorkout combines an open, gradual engagement model that allows any student to practice exercises, whether or not they have an account or are enrolled in a course, together with powerful course management features that support graded assignments, quizzes, and even practicum style exams. It also provides a rich data collection and evaluation infrastructure for educational research purposes.

This data is part of a PhD project and relates to Study 1. In this study we present a survey and study of the number of undergraduate computer science programs in Norway and map their characteristics in order to gather an up to date overview of the selection of programs. Through a systematic review of all Norwegian undergraduate programs using data from national databases we have found that there are 12 institutions offering 56 different programs in Norway in 2018. The study showed that the characteristics of these programs vary, that is, the amount of computer science courses during the first year, the number of students, admission requirements, student satisfaction and time commitment. This article presents these findings along with an analysis of what characteristics impact the students’ contentment and learning experience.",

In the process we have collected over 1.5M programs, which we can link to specific users at specific levels of expertise. We hope that researchers will embark on research into the data, discovering how coders code and how technology can be used to make the process more accurate and less painful. Although there has been research on how students code in the past, Microsoft Research is offering a unique opportunity to conduct research on large, common data sets. This preview data set contains the programs written by students (only) worldwide during a contest over 48 hours. There are approximately 250 users, 24 puzzles and about 13,000 programs.",

We show that students improve on typing character pairs that appear in frequently used words in programming languages, and that typing programming constructs also improves.

However, less attention has been paid to the actual code that students produce. In this paper, we investigate programming data by using learning curve analysis to determine which programming elements students struggle with the most when learning in Python. Our analysis extends the traditional use of learning curve analysis to include less structured data, and also reveals new possibilities for when to teach students new programming concepts. One particular discovery is that while we find evidence of student learning in some cases (for example, in function definitions and comparisons), there are other programming elements which do not demonstrate typical learning. In those cases, we discuss how further changes to the model could affect both demonstrated learning and our understanding of the different concepts that students learn.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research},\npages = {143–151},\nnumpages = {9},\nkeywords = {educational data mining, learning curve analysis, knowledge components, programming syntax},\nlocation = {Melbourne, VIC, Australia},\nseries = {ICER '16}\n}"

Traditional FLA textbooks are heavy on prose, and homework typically consists of solving many paper exercises. Instructors often make use of Finite State Machine simulators like the JFLAP package. JFLAP allows students to interactively build models and apply different algorithms to these models, providing both a more interactive and a more visual approach. However, course materials have still traditionally relied largely on prose and hand-graded exercises, limiting both the interaction and the amount of practice. In this paper, we propose an eTextbook with integrated tools (simulators and auto-graded exercises) that allow for greater interactivity and levels of engagement. To evaluate the pedagogical effectiveness of our approach, we conducted performance evaluations across different offerings of an FLA course. Results indicate that students using the integrated eTextbook performed better than did a control group using a traditional textbook approach. Students gave positive feedback regarding the usefulness of the auto-graded exercises for practicing different FLA concepts.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education},\npages = {569–575},\nnumpages = {7},\nkeywords = {visualizations, formal languages, auto-graded exercises, OpenFLAP, OpenDSA, JFLAP},\nlocation = {Virtual Event, USA},\nseries = {SIGCSE '21}\n}"

The review encompasses all SIGCSE venues and major journals in the field, providing a perspective of the current landscape on teaching and assessing creativity, in the context of computing in higher education. We identify which papers explore creativity as a central theoretical basis, revealing eight major themes. We also found seven commonly used measurement instruments. Creativity theories that are notably absent are also discussed, as are pedagogical implications of the approaches to fostering creativity in computing education. This paper serves to support the community by highlighting the interdisciplinary aspects of creativity research applicable in computing contexts.

As K-12 computing education becomes more established throughout the world, there is an increasing focus on accessibility for all, whether in a particular country or setting or in areas of the world that may not yet have computing established. This is primarily articulated as an equity issue. The recently developed capacity for, access to, participation in, and experience of computer science education (CAPE) Framework is one way of demonstrating stages and dependencies and understanding relative equity, taking into consideration the disparities between sub-populations. While there is existing research that covers the state of computing education and equity issues, it is mostly in high-income countries; there is minimal research in the context of low-middle-income countries like the sub-Saharan African countries.Objectives. The objective of the article is therefore to report on a pilot study investigating the capacity (one of the equity issues), for delivering computing education in four sub-Saharan African countries: Botswana, Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda, countries that are in different geographic regions as well as in different income brackets (low-middle income).Method. In addition to reviewing the capacity issues of curriculum and policy around computing education in each country, we surveyed 58 teachers about the infrastructure, resources, professional development, and curriculum for computing in their country. We used a localized version of the MEasuring TeacheR Enacted Computing Curriculum (METRECC) instrument for this purpose.Results. We analyzed the results through the lens of the CAPE framework at the capacity level. We identified similarities and differences in the data from teachers who completed the original METRECC survey, all of whom were from high-income countries and African teachers. The data revealed statistically significant differences between the two datasets in relation to access to resources and professional development opportunities in computer studies/computer science, with the African teachers experiencing more barriers. Results further showed that African teachers focus less on teaching algorithms and programming than teachers from high-income countries. In addition, we found differences between African countries in the study, reflecting their relative access to IT infrastructure and resources.Discussion. The findings suggest that African countries are still struggling with the lowest level of the CAPE pyramid, Capacity for as compared to high-income countries. This level is concerned with the availability of resources that support the enactment of a computing curriculum of high quality. The CAPE framework helps map the progression from Capacity for to Experience of computer science education as a route to equity, but to support development in low and middle-income countries, it may be helpful to have the capacity level finely grained. Such an adaptation draws out dependencies between policy and vision, infrastructure, curriculum implementation, and teacher professional development. More research is recommended to investigate these dependencies further and thus support and facilitate the development of global computing education.},\njournal = {ACM Trans. Comput.

The project focuses on the use and implementation of learning analytics methods. The DiP-iT project aims to develop didactic and technical support in computer science studies for learning to program in teams. In order to achieve this goal, the sub-study \"Gruppenarbeit beim Programmieren lernen\" (GAPL; engl: Group work in Learning Programming)  first took stock of the initial situation at the three locations of the joint universities (TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg and Humboldt University Berlin). Interviews with lecturers (data set 1) and students (data set 2) of the three participating universities were conducted to determine the initial situation. It was analyzed to what extent cooperative and collaborative methods are already used in teaching to learn programming. Subsequently, it can be deduced, among other things, how collaborative programming learning can be supported in the future (technically, didactically, organizationally,\n etc.), where unused potentials lie and which obstacles must be considered in an implementation. \n\nThe lecturers hold basic courses on learning to program in computer science and were asked, for example, about the extent to which they use group work in their courses and what opportunities and risks they see in group work. The students of computer science have already participated in basic courses on learning to program in computer science or are participating in them in the semester of the interview. Among other things, they were asked about the extent to which they used group work in the course, how they experienced group work, and what opportunities and risks they see in group work.",

In this domain, so far, misconceptions have mostly been studied with qualitative methods, typically via interviews with less than 20 subjects. We discuss workflows for (1) determining the commonness of qualitatively established misconceptions by quantitative means; and for (2) the initial discovery of misconceptions by quantitative methods followed by qualitative assessments.Parts of these workflows are then applied to a data set for exercises on logical modeling from the intelligent tutoring system Iltis with &gt; 250 data points for many of the exercises. We analyze the data in order to (1) determine the commonness of qualitativelyidentified misconceptions on modeling in propositional logic; and to (2) discover typical mistakes in modeling in propositional logic, modal logic, and first-order logic.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 54th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V. 1},\npages = {465–471},\nnumpages = {7},\nkeywords = {formal methods, first-order logic, propositional logic, modal logic, misconceptions, intelligent tutoring system},\nlocation = {Toronto ON, Canada},\nseries = {SIGCSE 2023}\n}\""

Meanwhile, automated program repair (APR) is an emerging new technology that automatically fixes software bugs, and it has been shown that APR can fix the bugs of large real-world software. In this paper, we study the feasibility of marrying intelligent programming tutoring and APR. We perform our feasibility study with four state-of-the-art APR tools (GenProg, AE, Angelix, and Prophet), and 661 programs written by the students taking an introductory programming course. We found that when APR tools are used out of the box, only about 30\\% of the programs in our dataset are repaired. This low repair rate is largely due to the student programs often being significantly incorrect - in contrast, professional software for which APR was successfully applied typically fails only a small portion of tests. To bridge this gap, we adopt in APR a new repair policy akin to the hint generation policy employed in the existing ITSP. This new repair policy admits partial repairs that address part of failing tests, which results in 84\\% improvement of repair rate. We also performed a user study with 263 novice students and 37 graders, and identified an understudied problem; while novice students do not seem to know how to effectively make use of generated repairs as hints, the graders do seem to gain benefits from repairs.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2017 11th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering},\npages = {740–751},\nnumpages = {12},\nkeywords = {Intelligent Tutoring System, Automated Program Repair},\nlocation = {Paderborn, Germany},\nseries = {ESEC/FSE 2017}\n}"

To overcome the low repair rate of APR tools (due to that student programs are often severely incorrect), we introduce a new repair policy and strategy tailored to programming tutoring (described in Section 6 of our paper), which is implemented in our toolchain. In this repository, we share the artifacts we used in our study.

Moreover, the data can be used for training intelligent program synthesizers or benchmarking mutation testing frameworks, and more applications are yet to be discovered. We describe the architecture of the DTA system, aiming to provide detailed insight regarding how and why the dataset was collected. In addition, we describe the algorithms responsible for source code analysis in the DTA system. These algorithms use vector representations of programs based on Markov chains, compute pairwise Jensen&ndash;Shannon divergences of programs, and apply hierarchical clustering algorithms in order to automatically discover high-level concepts used by students while solving unique tasks. The proposed approach can be incorporated into massive programming courses when there is a need to identify approaches implemented by students.},\nDOI = {10.3390/data8060109}\n}"
