      <h1>About the SPLICE Catalog</h1>
      <p class="intro-text">
        The SPLICE Catalog supports the CS Education community by
        providing access to free-to-use resources for education and
        research.
        The focus is on Smart Learning Content, generally meaning
        interactive visualizations, demonstrations, and exercises.
        There are also catalogs listing free-to-use tools for building
        and bundling SLC items, and datasets for researchers
        presenting data related to student use of SLC.
      </p>
