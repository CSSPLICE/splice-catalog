# Introduction

The Splice Catalog system is designed to manage and classify educational content, leveraging a draft ontology to ensure accurate and meaningful categorization. It enables users to search, upload, and explore content with metadata-driven classification.

Currently the splice catalog does the following:

- **Ontology Management:** Define and manage ontology classes, and relationships and aliases.
- **Content Classification:** Classify contributions based on keywords upon uplaod
- **Metadata Validation:** Validate content metadata and provide feedback of validations
