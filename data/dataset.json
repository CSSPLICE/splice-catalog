It also logs complete snapshots of students’ code after each edit, allowing for complete replay of a student’s\nactions within the environment. Each entry in iSnap’s logs\nconsists of an event type (e.g. “block grabbed”, “project exported”), any associated data (e.g. an ID for the grabbed\nblock) and an updated snapshot of the student’s code (if\nchanged). While this data could have many uses, we use it\nspecifically to automatically generate contextual hints\"",
